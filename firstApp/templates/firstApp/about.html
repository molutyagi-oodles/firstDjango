    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Welcome to <strong>My First Django Project</strong>! This project is designed as a learning journey into web development using Django, Python, and Tailwind CSS.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        We're building a simple yet powerful platform that includes user authentication, task management, and more â€” all styled with Tailwind for a clean and modern UI.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Stay tuned as we continue to add features like a full task manager, improved token authentication, and a better user experience overall.
